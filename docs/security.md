# Security Best Practices

This document outlines security best practices for using CopilotEdge in production environments.

## API Credentials

- **Never hardcode API tokens** in your source code or frontend applications.
- Use environment variables to store Cloudflare API credentials.
- Consider using a secrets manager for production deployments.
- Ensure API tokens have the minimum required permissions (Workers AI access).

## Authentication & Authorization

- Protect your API routes that use CopilotEdge with appropriate authentication.
- Consider implementing rate limiting at the application level.
- Use the built-in rate limiting feature with appropriate values for your use case.

## Content Filtering

- Always validate and sanitize user input before passing it to the API.
- Consider implementing content filtering for user prompts to prevent abuse.
- Set appropriate `max_tokens` values to prevent excessive token usage.

## Debug Mode in Production

CopilotEdge implements production safeguards for debug logging to prevent exposing sensitive information:

- Model names are redacted in production environment logs.
- Debug mode displays warnings when enabled in production.
- Specific fallback models are not revealed in logs when in production.

However, best practices include:

- **Disable debug mode in production** unless actively debugging an issue.

  ```javascript
  const handler = createCopilotEdgeHandler({
    apiKey: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN,
    accountId: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID,
    debug: process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production", // Only enable in non-production
  });
  ```

- If debug mode must be enabled in production, ensure logs are properly secured and not publicly accessible.

## Fallback Models

- When configuring fallback models, ensure both primary and fallback models have similar security and content policies.
- Validate that both models have appropriate data handling practices for your use case.

## Circuit Breaker Configuration

The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures but should be configured appropriately:

- For high-traffic production systems, consider increasing the failure threshold.
- Adjust open state timeout based on your system's recovery patterns.

## Cache Security

- Be aware that cached responses are stored in memory.
- For sensitive applications, consider reducing the cache timeout or disabling caching.
- CopilotEdge automatically implements LRU cache eviction to prevent memory leaks.

## Sensitive Content Detection

The `enableInternalSensitiveLogging` option is designed for development only:

- **NEVER enable this option in production environments.**
- This feature can log potentially sensitive patterns for debugging purposes.

## Regular Updates

- Keep CopilotEdge updated to the latest version to benefit from security fixes.
- Monitor Cloudflare Workers AI and OpenAI security advisories for model-specific guidance.

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling to prevent exposing sensitive information.
- Consider implementing custom error logging that filters out sensitive data.

By following these best practices, you can help ensure that your CopilotEdge implementation remains secure in production environments.
