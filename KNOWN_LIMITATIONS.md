# Known Limitations - v0.5.0

This document outlines known limitations in CopilotEdge v0.5.0. We believe in transparency and want users to make informed decisions.

## Test Coverage

**Current Status**: ~25% code coverage (71 functional tests passing)

While all major features have functional tests that pass, the overall code coverage is below industry standards. This means:

- ✅ **Well-tested**: Core functionality, KV caching, streaming, basic error handling
- ⚠️ **Limited testing**: Edge cases, complex error scenarios, network failures
- ⚠️ **Untested**: Some error recovery paths, timeout scenarios, malformed responses

**Mitigation**: 
- All 71 functional tests pass consistently
- Core features (KV, streaming, caching) have dedicated test suites
- v0.5.1 will focus on improving coverage to 80%+

## Production Considerations

### 1. Error Handling
- Some error paths may not be fully tested
- Recommend monitoring and alerting in production
- Use fallback models for critical applications

### 2. KV Cache Limitations
- KV errors fall back to memory cache (tested)
- Very large responses (>1MB) may have issues (untested)
- Concurrent write conflicts not extensively tested

### 3. Streaming Edge Cases
- Streaming works well in normal conditions
- Network interruption recovery not fully tested
- Very long streams (>5 minutes) not tested

### 4. Rate Limiting
- In-memory rate limiting (per instance only)
- Not suitable for distributed rate limiting
- Resets on Worker restart

## Recommended Usage

### ✅ Suitable For:
- Development and staging environments
- Production with proper monitoring
- Applications with fallback strategies
- Non-critical AI features

### ⚠️ Use With Caution:
- Mission-critical applications without fallbacks
- High-volume production without monitoring
- Applications requiring 100% uptime

## Improvement Roadmap

### v0.5.1 (Planned)
- Increase test coverage to 80%+
- Add integration tests for error scenarios
- Test network failure recovery
- Add performance benchmarks

### v0.6.0 (Future)
- Durable Objects for stateful sessions
- Distributed rate limiting
- Advanced error recovery
- WebSocket support

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check this document first
2. Review [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md)
3. [Report issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Klammertime/copilotedge/issues)
4. Include debug logs when possible

## Risk Mitigation

To minimize risks in production:

```typescript
// 1. Use fallback models
const handler = createCopilotEdgeHandler({
  model: '@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b',
  fallback: '@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', // Always have a fallback
});

// 2. Implement error handling
try {
  const response = await handler(request);
  return response;
} catch (error) {
  // Log to monitoring service
  console.error('CopilotEdge error:', error);
  // Return graceful fallback
  return new Response('AI temporarily unavailable', { status: 503 });
}

// 3. Monitor performance
const edge = new CopilotEdge(config);
const metrics = edge.getMetrics();
// Send metrics to monitoring service
```

## Transparency Commitment

We believe in honest communication about our software's limitations. This allows you to:
- Make informed decisions
- Implement appropriate safeguards
- Contribute to improvements

Despite these limitations, CopilotEdge v0.5.0 offers significant value:
- 90-95% cost reduction with KV caching
- Real-time streaming support
- 71 passing functional tests
- Active development and support

We're committed to addressing these limitations in upcoming releases.
